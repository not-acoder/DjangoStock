# DjangoStock
This website allows you to see the share price of a company after entering its ticker. Once you enter the ticker it shall display the current (or previous day closing) price of the stock along with some other details. You also have the option of adding stocks to the database , this helps you to view the details of these stocks in a tabular view all at once , you can also remove stocks from the database if you're no longer interested in them.



I am having trouble syncing the delete link with the table , since two for loops are to be run simultaenously the positioning of the delete 
links seem to be not corresponding with their stock counterparts
